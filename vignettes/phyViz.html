<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <strong>phyViz</strong> package allows phylogeneticists to visualize and interpret their trees in multiple ways, each which come with their pros and cons. This vignette is intended to walk readers through the different options available with the package.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> igraph must be used with version &gt;= 0.7.0</p><div id="preprocessing-pipeline" class="section level1"><h1>Preprocessing Pipeline</h1><p>There is a preprocessing pipeline that you must use before visualizing your phylogentic tree. First, you must load the necessary libraries. Note that loading the phyViz library should automatically load three required libraries (plyr, reshape2, igraph):</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>

It may be helpful to load that example file so that you can follow along with the commands and options introduced in this vignette. To ensure that you have uploaded the correct, raw <strong>sbTree.rda</strong> file, you can observe the first six lines of it:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>

The function <strong>treeToIG</strong> requires a data frame structured such that each line represents an edge, and takes optional arguments <em>vertexinfo</em> (a list of columns of the data frame which provide information for the starting “child” vertex, or a separate data frame containing information for each vertex with the first column as the vertex name), <em>edgeweights</em>, which default to 1 if not provided, and <em>isDirected</em>, which describes whether the graph is directed (true) or undirected (false); the default is false. In this example, we want a graph with edge weights of 1 and an undirected graph because our goal is to determine whether two vertices (individuals) are related. Hence, we use the default conditions:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">ig <- treeToIG(sbTree)</code></pre></div><p>We can add the other data we have about each of the nodes in ig in several ways. The sbTree dataset contains information about each child; to add that data as is to the tree, we can use the same command as before, but specify the vertexinfo parameter as follows:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">ig <- treeToIG(sbTree, vertexinfo = c("year", "yield", "year.imputed", "min.repro.year"))</code></pre></div><p>If we have separate data sets with node information, we can use that instead.

However, the shortest path between “Tokyo” and one of its great-reat-great-etc-granchildren, “Holladay” has a much higher degree. Note that degree calculations in this case are not limited to one linear string of parent-child relationships; cousins and siblings and products thereof will also have computatable degrees via nonlinear strings of parent-child relationships.</p></div><div id="functions-for-the-whole-tree" class="section level1"><h1>Functions for the Whole Tree</h1><p>There are many parameters about the tree that you may wish to know that cannot easily be obtained through images and tables.

For instance, is the whole tree connected? If not, how many separated components does it contain?

Then, any dramatic changes in protein yield, SNP varieties, and other measures of interest can be tracked across the genetic timeline, and pinpointed to certain varieties along the way.</p><p>The <strong>phyViz</strong> software can allow you to select two varieties of interest, and view the shortest pathway between them. You can produce a neat visual that informs you of all the varieties involved in the path between the two varieties of interest, as well as the years of all varieties involved in the path.</p><p>To produce and view this plot, two functions must be called in the order presented below (<strong>getPath</strong> and <strong>plotPath</strong>). We next introduce each of these two functions.</p><p>The <strong>getPath</strong> function determines the shortest path between the two inputted vertices, and takes into account whether or not the graph is directed. If there is a path, the list of vertices of the path (and their associated years) will be returned. For a directed graph, the direction matters. However, <strong>getPath</strong> will check both directions and return the path if it exists. The third parameter indicates the logical boolean of whether or not the graph is directed. Below, we look at all three possibilities (undirected and directed in reverse orders) between two varieties:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>

Rather, they are derived from a branch as some point, as siblings and/or cousins. Unless you are working with a dataset that must be analyzed as a directed graph, it is best to use the <strong>getPath</strong> function with the undirected specification (F) as the third parameter.</p><p>As such, we save the path between these two varieties to a variable called <strong>path</strong>:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">path <- getPath("Brim", "Bedford", ig, sbTree, isDirected = F)</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have a <strong>path</strong> object that consists of two lists (the variety names and years), we can plot the relationship between the two using plotPath(path)</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">plotPathDF <- plotPath(path)</code></pre></div><p>Indeed, as predicted above, the image verifies that the two varieties “Brim” and “Bedford” are cousin-like relationships, and are not connected by a linear string of parent-child relationships. Also, as mentioned above, in this plot, the x-axis represents the years, meaning that the center of the text box for each variety represents its corresponding year.</p><p>If, for some reason, you are looking at <em>directed</em> phylogenetic trees, you will need to use the true logical condition for the third parameter of the function <strong>getPath</strong>. The example below will hopefully reassure you that if you use this condition on a pathway composed of linear parent-child relationships, then either ordering of the first two parameters will work:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">dirgraph <- treeToIG(sbTree, vertexinfo = nodes, isDirected = TRUE)

The internal process is as follows: 
First, the **buildSpreadTotalDF** function creates a dataframe where the varieties are shuffled such that their overlap is minimized, even though the x-axis position will represent years. (Note: **binVector** will be explained in more detail at the end of this section).

```
binVector <- c(1,4,7,10,2,5,8,11,3,6,9,12)
spreadTotalDF <- buildSpreadTotalDF(ig, binVector)
head(spreadTotalDF)
```

Next, the **buildMinusPathDF** function takes the **ig** object and the **path** object (from the **getPath** function) as inputs. From these objects, it creates a data frame object of the label, x, and y values of all nodes in the tree. However, the data frame object does not include the labels of the path varieties, as they will be treated differently.

```
plotMinusPathDF <- buildMinusPathDF(path, ig)
head(plotMinusPathDF)
```

Third, the **buildEdgeTotalDF** function takes the **ig** object and creates a data frame object of the edges between all parent-child relationships in the graph.

```
edgeTotalDF <- buildEdgeTotalDF(ig)
head(edgeTotalDF)
```

Fourth, the **buildPlotTotalDF** function takes the **ig** object and the **path** object to create a data frame object of the text label positions for the varieties in the path, as well as the edges only in the varieties in the path.

```
plotTotalDF <- buildPlotTotalDF(path, ig)
head(plotTotalDF)
```

Now that we have generated the data frames needed to construct this type of visual object, we use them as input parameters to the **plotPathOnTree** function. 

--><p>The outputted image will correctly position the node labels with x-axis representing the node year, and y-axis representing the node path index. Light grey edges between two nodes represent parent-child relationships between those nodes. To enhance the visual understanding of how the path-of-interest fits into the entire graph structure, the nodes within the path are labelled in boldface, and connected with light-green boldfaced edges.</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>
<pre style=""><code class="source r">plotTotalImage <- plotPathOnTree(path = path, ig = ig)
plotTotalImage</code></pre><div class="row"><div class="col-md-offset-3 col-md-6"><a href="#" class="thumbnail"><img src="phyViz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" /> </a></div></div></div><p>Even though the edges of the large tree in this image are criss-crossing in all directions, that was not the focus, and hence the edges not belonging to the green path-of-interest are softly colored in a light gray. The highlight of this image was to keep all varieties in line with their appropriate year (corresponding to the x-axis), and to mitigate any overlap of the text of the varieties. Achieving this can be difficult, especially if your dataset has many varieties scrunched into a narrow set of years. That was the case with this dataset. As can be seen in the image above, most of the hundreds of varieties are associated with years between 1960 and 1975.</p><p>And this is where the explanation of the variable <strong>binVector</strong> (used as input parameters to the function <strong>spreadTotalDF</strong>) comes into play. As there is no uniform solution for this complicated problem, the <strong>phyViz</strong> package offers you the flexbility to changes these variables until you can optimize this image so that the text of the nodes of your tree overlap as little as possible. This can be done with a trial-and-error process by tweaking <strong>binVector</strong>’s order and length at the start.</p><p>Specifically, the length of <strong>binVector</strong> indicates how many bins of equal sizes should be allocated (where bins separate the vertices into groups of years). Theo order of <strong>binVector</strong> can be altered to avoid spatial collisions in labels.</p><p>The <strong>binVector</strong> will determine the order that increasing y index positions are repeatedly assigned to. For instance, if binVector = c(1,4,7,10,2,5,8,11,3,6,9,12), then y-axis position one will be assigned to a variety in the first bin of years, y-axis position two will be assigned to a variety in the fourth bin of years, …., and y-axis position thirteen will be assigned again to a variety in the first bin of years. This will be repreated until all varieties from all bins have been assigned in that order. This vector can help minimize overlap of the labelling of varieties, as varieites from the same bins (near each other on the x-axis for years) will not have consecutive y-axis values.</p><p>The two examples below will show the importance of selecting an appropriate number of bins and order of bins to minimize overlap:</p><div class="row"><button class="source R toggle btn btn-xs btn-primary"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></span> R source</button>

While some visualizations connect nodes to their years, other visualizations lax this idea, and instead connect nodes based on their generation surrounding a given node. And still other visualizations from <strong>phyViz</strong> will allow you to either focus on one pathway, or view that pathway superimposed across the entire tree for reference. Hopefully, the package will have something to offer to you in your data analysis.</p></div>
